# Udacity Personal Blog Website

In this project, I will write code across a handful of HTML and CSS files to create a personal blog website.

## Project rubic

- The project will be based on Udacity rubics

##

- The user does not need special tools to view the project. The project utilizes imported Google fonts that may not display if the user has not installed the fonts or does not have an internet connection.
- The project used false links and hyperlinks as placements for the project.
